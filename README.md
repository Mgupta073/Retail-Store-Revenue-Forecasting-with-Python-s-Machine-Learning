# Retail-Store-Revenue-Forecasting-with-Python-s-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on predicting the sales of items in Big Mart outlets using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset obtained from the Big Mart Sales Prediction challenge on Analytics Vidhya.

####Dataset

The dataset (Train.csv) contains various attributes such as item weight, item visibility, item MRP, outlet establishment year, item fat content, item type, outlet size, outlet location type, and outlet type.

####Usage

-Run the Jupyter Notebook Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction.ipynb to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build and evaluate the machine learning model.
-Modify the code as needed for experimentation and improvement.
-Refer to the documentation within the notebook for detailed explanations of each step.

####Technologies Used

-Python
-NumPy
-Pandas
-Matplotlib
-Seaborn
-Scikit-learn
-XGBoost
